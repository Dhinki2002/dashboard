model.extract_keywords("I'm an AI language model developed by OpenAI, designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the vast amount of data I've been trained on. My purpose is to assist, inform, and engage in conversations on a wide range of topics. I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I've been trained on diverse text from books, websites, articles, and more, up until my last update in early 2022. I strive to provide accurate information, generate creative content, and help users with queries, explanations, writing, or just about anything else they might need. My capabilities include understanding multiple languages, assisting with coding, offering advice, explaining concepts, and more. I'm continually learning and evolving based on new data and feedback to better serve and interact with users like you!.",keyphrase_ngram_range=(1,1),highlight=True, use_maxsum=True, top_n=3, nr_candidates=10)
